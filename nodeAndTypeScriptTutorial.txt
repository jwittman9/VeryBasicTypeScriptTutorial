//this is a very basic starting program using node and typescript
//this is mostly for my own refrence but you may find it useful
//you will need a npm and node
//CLI means command line interface
//install node here https://nodejs.org/en/
//open a cmd window
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng --version
cd Users
cd jjwitt18
mkdir angular-projects
cd angular-projects
ng new HelloWorld
y 
CSS
cd HelloWorld
ng serve // if you close your cmd window you will have to run this again or your 
//website will stop working
//cd over and over again back to users/jjwitt18/angular-projects/HelloWorld
code .
//open web browser http://localhost:4200/
//ctr + C get back to cmd line
//in visual studio src, app, app.componet.ts
//change title
cd ..
mkdir practice-typescript
cd practice-typescript
code first.ts
install -g typescript

//back in visual studio code
/*
inside document
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let c = a+b;
console.log(c);
*/
tsc first.ts
dir //to check directory files
code first.js
/* 
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = a + b;
console.log(c);
*/
node first.js
//output will be 15

//type script is a superset of java
//any valuid javascript is also typescript
//it brings addinoal info to compare to javascript 
//it doesnt have strong type. aka varables are extremely fluid
//it also brings oop feautres such as: class, constructor, objects, private/public
//catch syntax errors in compile time
//typescript uses something called transpile/convert to turn ts code into js code
